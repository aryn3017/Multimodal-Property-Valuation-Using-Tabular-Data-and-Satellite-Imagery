Satellite Imagery–Based Property Valuation
A Multimodal Machine Learning Approach

*1 Overview*

This project develops a multimodal regression pipeline for residential property valuation
by combining traditional tabular housing attributes with satellite imagery. The core objective
is to incorporate environmental and neighborhood context—such as green cover, road density,
and urban layout—into pricing models.
The final system uses a hybrid CNN + XGBoost architecture, where convolutional
neural networks extract visual representations from satellite images and a tree-based model
performs calibrated price prediction.

*2 Key Contributions*

• Programmatic acquisition of satellite images using the Mapbox Static Images API
• CNN-based feature extraction from satellite imagery
• Multimodal learning using tabular and visual features
• Model explainability using Grad-CAM
• Hybrid CNN + XGBoost model outperforming tabular-only baselines

*6 Data Preprocessing and EDA*

Run the preprocessing notebook:
jupyter notebook notebooks / preprocessing . ipynb
This step includes:
• Price distribution analysis
• Log transformation of the target variable
• Feature scaling for tabular data
• Geospatial sanity checks

*7 Multimodal CNN Training*

The end-to-end multimodal model combines CNN image embeddings with tabular features.
jupyter notebook  model_training . ipynb
7.1 Training Details
• Target: log(1 + price)
• Loss: Mean Squared Error (MSE)
• Evaluation metric: RMSE (log-price)
• Early stopping based on validation RMSE
The best-performing model is saved as:
outputs/best_model.pth

*8 Explainability with Grad-CAM*

Grad-CAM is applied to the CNN backbone to visualize which image regions influence predic-
tions.
Highlighted patterns include:
• Green spaces and tree cover
• Road connectivity
• Building density
• Neighborhood structure
Grad-CAM visualizations are stored in:
outputs/gradcam/

*9 Hybrid CNN + XGBoost Model*

To maximize performance, CNN-extracted image embeddings are concatenated with tabular
features and passed to an XGBoost regressor.
jupyter notebook notebooks / hybrid_xgb . ipynb
This hybrid approach leverages:
• CNNs for representation learning
• Tree-based models for calibration and nonlinear interactions

*10 Model Performance*

Model RMSE (log) Approx. Price Error R2
Tabular Baseline 0.277 ∼32% 0.72
CNN + MLP 0.291 ∼34% 0.69
Hybrid CNN + XGBoost 0.262 ∼30% 0.75

*11 Final Predictions*

The final submission file is generated as:
outputs/final_predictions.csv
Format:
id,predicted_price
Predictions are converted back from log(1 + price) to the original price scale.

*12 Reproducibility Notes*

• Fixed random seeds
• Consistent train/validation splits
• Identical preprocessing for train and test data
• No data leakage

*13 Conclusion*

This project demonstrates that satellite imagery provides complementary neighborhood-level
information for property valuation. While tabular models remain strong baselines, a hybrid
CNN + XGBoost approach achieves superior accuracy by combining deep visual representations
with robust tree-based regression.
